# Welcome to DeFutures

### product description
A fully decentralized Defi Solution

### The problems that we identified in DeFi that need to be solved:
1. The high volatility of investment products can disrupt users' liquidity supply.
2. There is no truly decentralized futures market.
3. It is difficult for users to self-hedge in both futures and spot markets.

### Our proposed solutions for each problem:
1. We implemented hedging between futures and spot markets to protect users' assets and allow them to earn fees from providing liquidity.
2. We created an AMM model that can be applied to futures markets and implemented the process of futures contracts on-chain.
3. We improved the user experience by enabling the entire hedging process to be done in a single transaction.
